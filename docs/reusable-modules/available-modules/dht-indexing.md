# Available Modules >> DHT Indexing ||30

These are libs that help index entries in the DHT. By indexing, here we mean a way of creating [paths](https://holochain-gym.github.io/developers/intermediate/paths/) and links from them that make it easy to search entries by time, ranking, tags, etc.

- [holochain-time-index](https://github.com/holochain-open-dev/holochain-time-index): index and search by time range.
- [ranking-index](https://github.com/holochain-open-dev/ranking-index): index and search by numerical ranking.
